Wandry UI is a comprehensive shadcn/ui registry that provides ready-to-use form components designed to work seamlessly with [@wandry/inertia-form](https://github.com/WandryDev/inertia-form). This registry simplifies form construction by offering a curated collection of form fields that integrate perfectly with Inertia.js applications.

## About @wandry/inertia-form

[@wandry/inertia-form](https://github.com/WandryDev/inertia-form) is a production-ready React form component library specifically built for Inertia.js applications. It provides essential form management capabilities including:

- **State Management**: Automatic form state handling and synchronization
- **Change Tracking**: Built-in change detection and dirty state management
- **Field Management**: Simplified field registration and validation
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript integration with type safety
- **Modern UI Integration**: Seamless integration with Radix UI, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS

The library serves as the foundation for form handling in Inertia.js applications, offering developers a robust and developer-friendly approach to building complex forms.

## Why Wandry UI?

Building forms in modern web applications often involves repetitive tasks and boilerplate code. Wandry UI addresses this challenge by providing:

### **Rapid Form Development**

Instead of creating form fields from scratch, developers can simply install pre-built components from the registry. This approach significantly reduces development time and ensures consistency across applications.

### **Consistent Design System**

All components in the registry follow the same design principles and patterns, ensuring visual and functional consistency throughout your application. This consistency improves user experience and reduces maintenance overhead.

### **Production-Ready Components**

Each component in the registry is battle-tested and production-ready. They handle edge cases, accessibility requirements, and provide robust error handling out of the box.

### **Seamless Integration**

Components are designed to work perfectly with @wandry/inertia-form, providing a cohesive development experience. No additional configuration or wrapper components are needed.

### **Extensibility**

While the registry provides ready-to-use components, the architecture allows for easy customization and extension to meet specific project requirements.

## What You Can Build

With Wandry UI, you can quickly construct various types of forms:

- **User Registration and Authentication Forms**
- **Data Collection and Survey Forms**
- **Settings and Configuration Forms**
- **Search and Filter Interfaces**
- **Multi-step Wizards**
- **Complex Data Entry Forms**

The registry provides components for common form patterns including text inputs, select dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and specialized fields like OTP inputs and password fields.
